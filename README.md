## Maze Raycaster Project

**Introduction**

This 3D maze game utilizes raycasting techniques to create an immersive and challenging experience. Navigate through the labyrinthine corridors, avoiding obstacles and (later on) enemies, to reach your destination.

**Installation**

The project requires the following:

* **OS:** Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* **Compiler:** gcc (version 4.8.4-2ubuntu1~14.04) 4.8.4
* **Development Library:** SDL2

**Instructions:**

1. **Download/Clone the Repository:** Obtain the project code from [link_to_repository] (https://github.com/rodgerswisdom/The-Maze-Game).
2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the required compiler and libraries installed on your Ubuntu system.
3. **Compile the Project:** Navigate to the project directory and run the appropriate compilation commands (consult the project documentation for specific instructions).

**Usage**

Once compiled, execute the project binary. The game will launch, and you can begin navigating the maze. Use the keyboard controls (WASD for movement, arrow keys or mouse for rotation) to interact with the environment. The specific controls and gameplay mechanics will be detailed within the project code itself.

## Maze Raycaster: A 3D Labyrinth Adventure  ‍♂️

**Inspiration & Why I Built This**

Ever get lost in a good book, transported to a fantastical world of twists and turns? That's the feeling I wanted to capture with this project - a 3D maze game built with raycasting!   I've always been fascinated by the illusion of depth raycasting creates, and I wanted to challenge myself to bring a maze to life using this technique.

**The Challenge: Building a World Line by Line (or Line of Code)**

This project wasn't just about creating a maze; it was about diving into the world of 3D graphics programming. Learning raycasting algorithms, handling player movement and collision detection - each step was a new hurdle to overcome. There were moments of frustration (hello, integer overflow errors!), but the satisfaction of seeing my code come together and render a convincing 3D environment was pure magic. ✨

**Technical Deep Dive: Raycasting to the Rescue!**

At the heart of this project lies the raycasting algorithm. Imagine firing invisible rays out from the camera's position, and calculating the point where these rays intersect with walls. The distance to these intersections determines which wall segments are drawn on the screen, creating the illusion of a 3D world.  Here's a simplified breakdown (check out the code for the nitty-gritty details!):

1. **Cast Rays:** For each pixel on the screen, a ray is cast into the 3D world.
2. **Wall Intersection:** We calculate the intersection point of the ray with the nearest wall.
3. **Draw & Shade:** Based on the distance and orientation of the wall, we draw the corresponding wall segment and apply shading for a more realistic look.

**What's Next? Taking the Maze to the Next Level!** 

This is just the beginning! My vision for the future iterations includes:

* **Enemies & Power-Ups:** Adding some creepy crawlies to the maze and power-ups to spice up the gameplay! ‍♂️⚡️
* **Multiple Levels:**  Imagine a series of increasingly complex mazes to conquer! 
* **Enhanced Graphics:** Textures, lighting effects - let's make this maze visually stunning! ✨
